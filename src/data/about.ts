    "Hi 👋. I'm Jose Valdivia, based in Maryland, where I build cool stuff.",

    "Ever since I can remember, I've had a passion for crafting things. My journey into the world of programming began at Montgomery College where I wrote my first program in C++ 👨‍💻; just after few weeks, everthing clicked and I was hooked. I was able to explain complex concepts in a simple way to my fellow students, and the best part, I enjoyed it.",

    "I graduated in 2022 from Montgomery College, and I was awarded with Honors in Computer Science, a great step for a foreign student. Yep, I am originally from Peru, but I received my naturalization in 2024. Now, I am a proud American citizen 🇺🇸. Currently, I am a senior student at University of Maryland, graduating soon with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science 👨‍🎓.",

    "In one summer of 2022, I learned different stacks and frameworks. My favorite one: React and Next.js. I was able to build a few projects, and surprisingly, I got an intern job as a Lead Software Engineer, where we built a Content Managment Service like Wordpress from scratch.",

    "Fast forward to today, and I am software engineer with experience collaborating with team members and serving as a charismatic leader. For the past few years, I've focused on highload server-side projects and love for building projects for the community.",
