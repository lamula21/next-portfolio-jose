- React version 16.8, allows use `state` and other React features without writing a class.
- Provides a way to manage logic and reuse code in functional components.
- There are many react hooks for different situations and utilities.

## `useState()` 

Built-in hook in React, is used keep track and store **immutable** data within your components. Similar to a global variable, but lives within the component.

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

### Use Cases
- Stores form input values
- Toggles buttons
- Manages any other stateful data.
- Any update in the state will re-render the component with the new `state`, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data.

### Parameters
- `initialState` - initial value of any type (**boolean**, **array**, **integer**, **string**, **object**).

### Returns

`useState()` returns an array with two values:
1. current state value. The first re-render will match `initialState`.
2. a setter function

```javascript showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // defining State

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```


## `useRef()` 
- Hook that allows creating mutable reference that persist across the component's lifecyle (similar to a mutable variable in Rust)
- Will not cause a re-render when it changes.
- Useful for storing any value that can mutate, such as identifier, DOM element, counter, etc

### useRef vs useState
- when UI is modified, `useRef()` does not trigger a re-render of the component. Stores a mutable value that persists across the component's lifecycle.
- when UI is modified, `useState()` triggers a re-render of the component. Stores a immutable value that persists across the component's lifecycle.

```javascript showLineNumbers
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```


## `useTransition()`
Improve performance by reducing the number of re-renders and DOM updates.

Use `startTransition`Â when you have a section of code that may cause multiple updates to occur, and you want to batch those updates together to improve performance. 

Batching refers to the process of queuing up state updates and re-renders to be executed in a single batch, rather than executing them one by one.



```javascript
function onSubmit(data: Inputs) {
    if (!isLoaded) return

    startTransition(async () => {
      try {
        const result = await signIn.create({
          identifier: data.email,
          password: data.password,
        })

        if (result.status === "complete") {
          await setActive({ session: result.createdSessionId })

          router.push(`${window.location.origin}/`)
        } else {
          /*Investigate why the login hasn't completed */
          console.log(result)
        }
      } catch (error) {
        const unknownError = "Something went wrong, please try again."

        isClerkAPIResponseError(error)
          ? toast.error(error.errors[0]?.longMessage ?? unknownError)
          : toast.error(unknownError)
      }
    })
  }
```
