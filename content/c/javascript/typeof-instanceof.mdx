description: typeof and instanceof are both operators in JavaScript that are used to check the type of a value or an object. However, they work differently and have different use cases.
---


## `typeof`

Returns a string indicating the type of an operand.

```javascript
typeof "Hello World" // => "string"
typeof 42 // => "number"
typeof true // => "boolean"

typeof undefined // => "undefined"
typeof null // => "object"

typeof [1, 2, 3] // => "object"
typeof { name: "John", age: 30 } // => "object"
```

**Note**:
- `typeof null` returns `"object"`, which is a known quirk of JavaScript. This is because `null` is considered an empty object reference in JavaScript.


## `instanceof`

Checks if an object is an instance of a particular class.

```javascript
var today = new Date();
today instanceof Date // => true
today instanceof Object // => true

var names = ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"];
names instanceof Array // => true
names instanceof Object // => true

var person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
person instanceof Object // => true
person instanceof Array // => false

```

In the above example,
- `today` is an instance of the `Date` class, 
- `names` is an instance of the `Array` class, and 
- `person` is an instance of the `Object` class.

## Summary
In summary, `typeof` checks the data type of a value or variable, while `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular class.
