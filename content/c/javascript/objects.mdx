description: All about Objects in JavaScript

Suppose we have the following object:

```javascript
const data = {
  id: "2",
  company: "Example Inc.",
  status: "Active",
  notes: "This is a note about the job."
};
```

## Built-in methods

### `for of`

- Iterates over an array
- `Object.entries(data)` returns an array of key-value pairs

```javascript
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(data)) {
  console.log(key, value);
}
```

### `for in`

Iterates over the `keys` of an object

```javascript
for (const key in data) { 
  const value = data[key]; 
  console.log(key, value); 
}
```

### `forEach()`
```javascript
Object.entries(data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(key, value);
});
```

## Restrict Object Behavior ⛔️

In JavaScript, you can add properties and methods to an object at any time (**extensible**). How can we stop this?


### Nonextensible Object
We can restrict **adding** properties and methods  by using `Object.preventExtensions()`. But we can modify the existing properties and methods


```javascript {4}
let student = new Object();
student.name = "Rose";

Object.preventExtensions(student); // prevent adding
Object.isExtensible(student) // False

student.gpa = 3.2; // ADDING, ❌ Allowed
student.name = "Mark"; // MODIFYING, ✅ Allowed
```

### Seal Object
What if we don't want properties deleted as well? Seal the Object

```javascript {4}
let game = new Object();
game.name = "SuperTetris";

Object.seal(game); // prevent deleting 
Object.isSealed(game) // True

delete game.name; // ❌ Allowed
```

### Freeze Object

Strictest protection: No extensible, sealed, and data properties can not be modified

```javascript {5}
let school = new Object();
school.name = "UMCP";
school.city = "College Park";

Object.freeze(school); // no modifying, no deleting, no adding

school.name = "UMD"; // MODIFYING, ❌ Allowed (Generates error)
delete school.city; // DELETING, ❌ Allowed (Generates error)
school.mascot = "terp"; // ADDING, ❌ Allowed (Generates error)
```
