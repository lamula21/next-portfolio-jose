Although stacks are not built into Javascript, they are easy to implement. 

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

We are going to use the following methods to implement a stack:
- `push`: adds an element to the top of the stack
- `pop`: removes the top element from the stack

## `push()`

```javascript
```

## `pop()`

```javascript
```
